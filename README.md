## Project Discontinued

Initially build to serve as a knowledge warehouse to reflect but, since it's static site. It's not scalable to be honest would be cumbersome to build it each time I add another activity to it.

It's actually could be converted to SSR, but I think the cost would be high, so I decided to not to and move to another solution, Notion.

But anyway, I learned a lot by building by project such as how integrate it with Stripe and pull the data with GraphQL.
